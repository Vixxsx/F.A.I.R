You were the right way
I was just waitin' for you to look at me
Is there a wrong time?
Baby, I'm guessin'
Just let me know
Just let me know
Well, it's been a long time
Since you've been lonely
So what will I do?
You are the right one
And I'm just the boy who is lookin' at you
So what will I do?
I tried the wrong way
I was just guessin', bidin' my time
You are the only one I can picture by my side
