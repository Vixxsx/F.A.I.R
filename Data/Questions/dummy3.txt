She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (pay up, pay up)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)
Like did you get the memo?
She eat out of the relay
I'm poppin' hella Skittles
Then I can solve your riddle
We'll smoke you like it's menthol
This dude is crazy mental
A suave, hood hero
Got Johnny Dang dental
She's a nympho
She slobbin' on her pillow
Got chicken, Rob' De Niro
She's too gone and she can't hear, yeah (ooh, ooh, I know)
