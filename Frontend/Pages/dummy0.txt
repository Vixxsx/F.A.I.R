Oh-ohOh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
If I could do it, then why can't you? (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Get up and make it work (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

Yo, if I could do it, then why can't you? (Why?) Huh, get up and make it work
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around, it's now or never, I'm picking it first (Yeah, I'm picking it first)
You can't tell me that I won't make it, knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt
Still came far cah I put in the work (Yeah, yeah)
Painting a picture when I write lyrics, don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist
This weren't by chance or luck, I took one shot and I hit my target (One shot)
I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (Still charging)
They don't wanna see me win, but I know in the end, I'm winning regardless
