She's such a freak
Bad and freaky, yeah
We still don't trust you
We still don't trust you (Metro)
We still don't trust you (you fell apart, gradual)
We still don't trust you (we broke your heart from the start)
We still don't trust you (no, oh-whoa)
We still don't trust you (whoa-oh, oh)
We still don't trust you (oh-oh)
We still don't trust you (whoa-oh, oh)
We still don't trust you
And the Paris girls, they sing my song with love
In the stadium is where I feel at home
I forgot the feelin' of arena shows
And she love the stage, it got her sexual
Electricity, transparency, higher than we will ever be
I am lovin' our chemistry
Still don't trust you (you fell apart, gradual)
We still don't trust you (we broke your heart from the start)
We still don't trust you (whoa-oh, oh)
We still don't trust you (whoa-oh, oh)
