Yeah, call me when you need it late at night, you know I'm slidin'
I heard you been dreamin' 'bout me lately, girl, I'm ridin'
Tell me that you think about me 'cause you're on my mind, bae
You ain't gotta check your watch, you know I'm on that time, bae

Yeah, call me when you need it late at night, you know I'm slidin'
I heard you been dreamin' 'bout me lately, girl, I'm ridin'
Tell me that you think about me 'cause you're on my mind, bae
You ain't gotta check your watch, you know I'm on that time, bae
Let's keep it cool and break it down
Break it like some sticky glue
If you bring your friend, then I'll bring two
Pussy taste sweet like it's tiramisu
