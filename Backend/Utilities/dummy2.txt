Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing

You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me

All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
