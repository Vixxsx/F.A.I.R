It's Friday then
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday then, -en, -en, -en

I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out
I'm countin' down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah
