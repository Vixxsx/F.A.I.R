I'm hooked on you, honey
Never letting you go
'Cause I got desire
It's starting to show
I'm holding you tightly
Bathing inside your glow
'Cause I got a fire
I feel it starting to grow
Here's the thing
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you
Here, just thinking about you
'Til the stars burn blue
Call it sad, call it funny
I don't care to know
'Cause I got desire
And I can't let you go
Here's the thing
I can't stop thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you
Here, just thinking about you
'Til the stars burn blue
